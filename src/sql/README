This README describes how to setup the oradumper as an Oracle external procedure.

INSTALLATION
============
1) Create and install the oradumper shared library as described in the INSTALL document (../..).

2) Modify your listener or create a separate listener for external procedures.
See http://rjh.keybit.net/oracle/Chapter%2018.htm for details.

3) Run admin.sql to create an Oracle library based on the shared library.
Please note that shared library names depend on the platform.

Some examples: 
- oradumper.dll (Windows)
- liboradumper.dylib (MAC OS X)
- liboradumper.so (Linux/ some Unixes)
- liboradumper.sl (some Unixes)

4) Run oradumper.sql to create the Oracle oradumper procedure.

5) Test it using 

SECURITY
========
There are several security issues related to external procedures.

The main security problem is that the Oracle listener will start the
extproc executable as the Oracle O/S account by default.  So it may be
possible to destroy database files when an Oracle account can create a
library based on the C library (libc.so on Unix).

Solutions
---------

1) Create Oracle libraries by a privileged Oracle account only, for instance a DBA.

It is not necessary to grant the CREATE LIBRARY / CREATE ANY LIBRARY to other users.
The DBA can create a library in another schema (see admin.sql).

This will make it impossible for a non-privileged Oracle account to
create libraries on his own and therefore gain access to the functions
in shared libraries.

2) Restrict the number of shared libraries which can be used for external procedures.

Put a line with ENVS like this in your listener.ora:

    (SID_DESC =
      (SID_NAME = PLSExtProc)
      (ORACLE_HOME = /Volumes/u01/app/oracle/product/10.1.0/db_1)
      (PROGRAM = extproc)
      (ENVS = "EXTPROC_DLLS=ONLY:/usr/local/lib/liboradumper.so")
    )

3) Create a separate listener for external procedures and run that listener under a restricted O/S account.

The extproc executable should NOT have the sticky bit set (on Unix).

See the Oracle listener documentation for more information about how to setup another listener.
