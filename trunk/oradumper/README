This is 'ORADUMPER', a program and library to dump Oracle SELECT
statements to a flat file.  For more information see
www.sourceforge.net/projects/transferware.

ORADUMPER itself consists of the library, liboradumper.la, an oradumper
program and the headers installed. 

Besides this, an Oracle external procedure can be built upon the library
when the configure option --enable-extproc has been specified. See
src/sql/README for details.

This package depends on the package DBUG (see
www.sourceforge.net/projects/transferware). This should be installed
into the same lib and bin directories as ORADUMPER (e.g. use the same
prefix when installing).

QUALITY CHECKS
==============
ORADUMPER can be checked using the check library
(http://check.sourceforge.net). Currently this does not work for Windows
(Cygwin). 

The following may be tested depending on configure options:
- full code coverage using the GNU code coverage program gcov.
- memory leaks or corruption using dmalloc (only for the oradumper
  library, but not the Oracle libraries).
- lint checking in src/lib using splint (http://www.splint.org).

The following configure command enables code coverage and checking memory:

$ configure --enable-gcov --with-dmalloc

VERSIONS
========
The following combinations are known to work:

ORADUMPER     DBUG	   CHECK
---------     ----	   -----
>= 1.0.0      >= 4.0.0	   >= 0.9.5

DOCUMENTATION
=============
Run the oradumper program without arguments to get help.

INSTALLATION
============
Installation using the GNU build tools is described in INSTALL. 

Windows specific
================
For Windows platforms the Cygwin suite with GCC and the MinGW extension
can be used. There is one caveat: the libraries should not depend on the
Cygwin DLL, but on the Microsoft run-time DLLs instead. See the file
BUGS in the DBUG distribution for more information.

The configure script will try to set the environment correctly. In case
that fails the following configure command may be tried (provided dbug
is installed into /cygdrive/c/usr/local):

./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/cygdrive/c/usr/local/include" \
LDFLAGS="-L/cygdrive/c/usr/local/lib" \
CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" --prefix=/cygdrive/c/usr/local

AIX specific
============
When on AIX the xlc compiler is used, pthreads must be added to the
compiler and linkers flags. So when dbug has been installed with prefix
$HOME this is the command to configure oradumper.

./configure --prefix=$HOME \
CC="cc -qlanglvl=extc89 -pthreads" \
CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/include" \
LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/lib -L$ORACLE_HOME/lib32" \
LIBS="-ln10 -lpthreads"
