This is 'ORADUMPER', a program and library to dump Oracle SELECT
statements to a flat file.  For more information see
www.sourceforge.net/projects/transferware.

ORADUMPER itself consists of the library, liboradumper.la, an oradumper
program and the headers installed. 

Besides this, an Oracle external procedure can be built upon the library
when the configure option --enable-extproc has been specified. See
src/sql/README for details.

This package depends on the package DBUG (see
www.sourceforge.net/projects/transferware). This should be installed
into the same lib and bin directories as ORADUMPER (e.g. use the same
prefix when installing).

QUALITY CHECKS
==============
ORADUMPER can be checked using the check library
(http://check.sourceforge.net). Currently this does not work for Windows
(Cygwin) because the check library is compiled against the Cygwin
run-time DLL and not against the Windows run-time DLL's.

The following may be tested depending on configure options:
- full code coverage using the GNU code coverage program gcov.
- memory leaks or corruption using dmalloc (only for the oradumper
  library, but not the Oracle libraries).
- lint checking in src/lib using splint (http://www.splint.org).

The following configure command enables code coverage and checking memory:

$ configure --enable-gcov --with-dmalloc

VERSIONS
========
The following combinations are known to work:

ORADUMPER     DBUG	   CHECK
---------     ----	   -----
>= 1.0.0      >= 4.0.0 >= 0.9.5

DOCUMENTATION
=============
Run the oradumper program without arguments to get help.

INSTALLATION
============
Installation using the GNU build tools is described in INSTALL. 

Windows specific
================
For Windows platforms the Cygwin suite with GCC and the MinGW extension
can be used. There is one caveat: the libraries should not depend on the
Cygwin DLL, but on the Microsoft run-time DLLs instead. See the file
BUGS in the DBUG distribution for more information.

AIX specific
============
On AIX (tested on powerpc-ibm-aix5.3.0.0) the xlc_r compiler should be
used which is tailored for threading. So when DBUG has been installed
with prefix $HOME, this is the command to configure oradumper with DBUG
code disabled:

$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME --enable-extproc \
        CC="xlc_r" \
        CFLAGS="-O2" \
        CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/include -DDBUG_OFF" \
        LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/lib"

Next when you run:

$ make install

you will receive a warning message like:

libtool: link: xlc_r -O2 -o .libs/oradumper main.o  -L/ING/ORACLE/product/10.1.0.5/lib32 -L/home/z657p80/lib -L../../src/lib/.libs -loradumper -ldbug -lpthreads -ln10 -lclntsh -pthreads -Wl,-blibpath:/home/z657p80/lib:/ING/ORACLE/product/10.1.0.5/lib32:/home/z657p80/lib:/usr/vac/lib:/usr/lib/threads:/usr/lib:/lib
xlc_r: 1501-210 command option t contains an incorrect subargument

This will cause the run-time executable to dump a file mon.out for every
invocation. To prevent this, copy the line before the warning to a
script named S while removing "libtool: link: " and "-pthreads" from
that line.

Now issue the following commands:

$ cd src/prog
$ make clean all
$ . <path to script S>
$ make install

Now the executable will not create the file mon.out anymore.
